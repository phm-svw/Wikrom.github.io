      <h1><mark>Photoshop Flowey is the powered up version of Flowey after he absorbs the six human SOULs at the end of a Neutral Route. He serves as the final boss of that route if the protagonist has not defeated him before since the last True Reset or Genocide Route.</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
       <h1><mark>Profile</h1></mark>
       <hr width=50% size=5 color=gray>
      <h1><mark>Appearance</mark></h1>
      <h1><mark>After absorbing the human SOULs, Flowey transforms into a grotesque, flower-shaped hybrid of plant tissue, human organs, and machinery. Consisting entirely of rendered images, Photoshop Flowey is stylistically different from anything else in the game.</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
      <h1><mark>The middle of his body has a contorted human face with two mandibles on the bottom and a TV monitor on top. The monitor either displays a laughing pixelated face, or a black and white image of a yelling human face, presumably of Toby Fox himself. The pixelated face has sideways eyes that flash red and green, and a big mouth with large, blocky teeth. The face can also escape the screen when it laughs, as the mouth seems to pop out of the bottom.</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
       <h1><mark>Around the monitor and face are 6 curved tubes, one for each soul that resemble the petals of Flowey's normal form, and the areas inside flash the colors of the souls when the protagonist is about to encounter one. The second row also has a floating pair of eyeballs inside of them. Once each Soul is encountered, the corresponding tube becomes darker in color. On either side of the main body are more tubes connected to long cactus-like appendages that perpetually move out from the body. Further down are more vine-covered cacti that have been shaped into arms, with three thorns on each hand acting as fingers or claws.</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
      <h1><mark>Photoshop Flowey's new body resembles that of the DT Extraction Machine's structure, albeit now filled with teeth, gums, and eyeballs. Alphys used this machine to extract Determination from six previously captured human SOULs — the same SOULs that Photoshop Flowey uses to power himself.</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
    <h1><mark>Main Story</mark></h1>
    <hr width=50% size=5 color=gray>
     <h1><mark>At the conclusion of the Neutral Route battle with Asgore, Flowey appears and finishes off the weakened king of monsters following his dialogue to the protagonist. He then absorbs the six bottled human SOULs to increase his strength, repeating his main line "in this world... it's KILL or BE killed." As he absorbs the SOULs, Flowey's face becomes horribly twisted in a way not previously witnessed. The game then immediately closes (on the PC version) or returns to the introduction cinematic automatically (on console versions).</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
     <h1><mark>The introduction cinematic that plays (either when opening the game again on PC, or immediately on consoles) has been altered—the Boss Monster is replaced with a Loox (similar to the Undertale Demo). Additionally, there is no "typewriter" sound as the text is shown on screen, and the first line is laid out at a jittery pace. After "one day, the" is displayed on the second line, the remaining part of the sentence ("One day, they all disappeared without a trace.") appears all at once, and the image corrupts. On PC versions, during the broken intro the window title changes rapidly to lines of random letters and numbers. A glitched noise plays until the player presses [(CONFIRM)].</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
    <h1><mark>The game then presents the option to load a SAVE of Flowey's creation, the location being simply "My World". On the PC version, the window name changes to Floweytale. Loading the SAVE file displays a blank screen name. The SAVE is under Flowey's name, his LV is 9999, and the play time is 9999:99. The player can only choose the "Continue" option, as any attempts to choose "Restart" are ineffective.</mark></h1>
