      <h1><mark>Photoshop Flowey is the powered up version of Flowey after he absorbs the six human SOULs at the end of a Neutral Route. He serves as the final boss of that route if the protagonist has not defeated him before since the last True Reset or Genocide Route.</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
       <h1><mark>Profile</h1></mark>
       <hr width=50% size=5 color=gray>
      <h1><mark>Appearance</mark></h1>
      <h1><mark>After absorbing the human SOULs, Flowey transforms into a grotesque, flower-shaped hybrid of plant tissue, human organs, and machinery. Consisting entirely of rendered images, Photoshop Flowey is stylistically different from anything else in the game.</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
      <h1><mark>The middle of his body has a contorted human face with two mandibles on the bottom and a TV monitor on top. The monitor either displays a laughing pixelated face, or a black and white image of a yelling human face, presumably of Toby Fox himself. The pixelated face has sideways eyes that flash red and green, and a big mouth with large, blocky teeth. The face can also escape the screen when it laughs, as the mouth seems to pop out of the bottom.</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
       <h1><mark>Around the monitor and face are 6 curved tubes, one for each soul that resemble the petals of Flowey's normal form, and the areas inside flash the colors of the souls when the protagonist is about to encounter one. The second row also has a floating pair of eyeballs inside of them. Once each Soul is encountered, the corresponding tube becomes darker in color. On either side of the main body are more tubes connected to long cactus-like appendages that perpetually move out from the body. Further down are more vine-covered cacti that have been shaped into arms, with three thorns on each hand acting as fingers or claws.</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
      <h1><mark>Photoshop Flowey's new body resembles that of the DT Extraction Machine's structure, albeit now filled with teeth, gums, and eyeballs. Alphys used this machine to extract Determination from six previously captured human SOULs — the same SOULs that Photoshop Flowey uses to power himself.</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
    <h1><mark>Main Story</mark></h1>
    <hr width=50% size=5 color=gray>
     <h1><mark>At the conclusion of the Neutral Route battle with Asgore, Flowey appears and finishes off the weakened king of monsters following his dialogue to the protagonist. He then absorbs the six bottled human SOULs to increase his strength, repeating his main line "in this world... it's KILL or BE killed." As he absorbs the SOULs, Flowey's face becomes horribly twisted in a way not previously witnessed. The game then immediately closes (on the PC version) or returns to the introduction cinematic automatically (on console versions).</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
     <h1><mark>The introduction cinematic that plays (either when opening the game again on PC, or immediately on consoles) has been altered—the Boss Monster is replaced with a Loox (similar to the Undertale Demo). Additionally, there is no "typewriter" sound as the text is shown on screen, and the first line is laid out at a jittery pace. After "one day, the" is displayed on the second line, the remaining part of the sentence ("One day, they all disappeared without a trace.") appears all at once, and the image corrupts. On PC versions, during the broken intro the window title changes rapidly to lines of random letters and numbers. A glitched noise plays until the player presses [(CONFIRM)].</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
    <h1><mark>The game then presents the option to load a SAVE of Flowey's creation, the location being simply "My World". On the PC version, the window name changes to Floweytale. Loading the SAVE file displays a blank screen name. The SAVE is under Flowey's name, his LV is 9999, and the play time is 9999:99. The player can only choose the "Continue" option, as any attempts to choose "Restart" are ineffective.</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
    <h1><mark>In this SAVE, the protagonist begins in a seemingly endless dark void. As they walk north, they find a SAVE Point. However, when the protagonist interacts with the SAVE Point, their SAVE file is destroyed: the dialogue box is repeatedly cracked as though it is being rammed and physically exists, not just as a user interface. Flowey's face, much larger than normal, then bursts through the dialogue box. Flowey mockingly thanks the protagonist for unwittingly helping him destroy Asgore's SOUL, and gloats that he is now in control of the six human SOULs.</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
    <h1><mark>He states that once he absorbs the seventh SOUL — the protagonist's — he will become godlike, and proceed to show everyone the "REAL meaning of this world," which is to kill or be killed. He also reinforces the fact that the protagonist will not be able to use their SAVE file to escape to an earlier part of the game, even going as far as to declare that it is "gone forever," before stating that he will "SAVE over [the protagonist's] own death." If the protagonist did not create a save file, Flowey taunts them for being "too stupid to make one."</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
    <h1><mark>The protagonist is then thrust into battle against Photoshop Flowey, after a cinematic showing the approach of the creature as a black silhouette on a red background. While this occurs, "Your Best Nightmare" plays. This fight is not RPG-oriented, instead being a conventional bullet hell encounter, with the objective being to survive an onslaught of Flowey's attacks. It is immediately obvious that this battle is different, in that the protagonist does not have the option to FIGHT, ACT, use an ITEM, or show MERCY right away. The battle is completely independent of the protagonist's SAVE file—their HP is set to 50 during the battle regardless of their LOVE or any EXP previously earned.</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
    <h1><mark>During this battle, if the protagonist dies, they receive a GAME OVER screen in which the text "This is all just a bad dream..." is displayed in Asgore's voice, followed by "And you're NEVER waking up!" in Flowey's aggressive voice. The screen is then filled with a scrolling wall of "HAHAHA" while Flowey laughs. In the PC version, the game cannot be closed during this GAME OVER screen via Esc or F4, forcing the player to wait out the sequence. After the wall of "HAHAHA", the game immediately closes (in the PC version) or returns to the introduction cinematic (in the console versions).</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
    <h1><mark>Photoshop Flowey attacks in a multitude of ways: firing star-shaped projectiles from his eyes, striking with numerous vines that cross over each other in a downwards strike, flamethrowers, finger guns, pulling in flies, dropping bombs with little Flowey faces on them, and firing lasers. Flowey also invokes the six human SOULs, with each human SOUL giving an attack based on their associated objects and concepts.</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
    <h1><mark>Each of the six SOULs (in order, light blue, orange, dark blue, purple, green, and yellow) has its own 'phase' of the battle, featuring unique attacks which must be avoided. During the attacks of the six human SOULs, the protagonist can call for help from each SOUL by pressing ACT buttons that appear among the attacks of the SOULs. This action causes the white bullets to be replaced with positive green bullets which heal the protagonist.</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
    <h1><mark>After requesting assistance from each of the six SOULs, "Your Best Nightmare" transitions into "Finale", and the SOULs leave Photoshop Flowey temporarily to encourage the protagonist to defeat Flowey. They do so by providing the protagonist with more than enough healing projectiles to fully heal them, and by reducing Photoshop Flowey's defense to 0. The SOULs continue assisting the protagonist by sending them a healing item at times while allowing the protagonist to deal a decent amount of damage as well. The fight continues until they reduce Photoshop Flowey's HP to 0.</mark></h1>
      <br><br>
    <h1><mark>When the protagonist does defeat Photoshop Flowey, he feigns panic and curses the protagonist for defeating him before simply reloading FILE 3, a save file he created at the very beginning of the fight. This action, of course, results in Flowey (and also the protagonist) regaining all lost health. He then taunts the protagonist by killing them and then reloading the save file 32 times in rapid succession. Flowey then encircles the protagonist's SOUL with bullets, much like he did at the beginning of the game, and saves the file there (as FILE 6).

<h1><mark>After jeering about how helpless the protagonist is, he then dares them to call for help. An ACT button appears for the protagonist, and pressing it results in a call for help. Nothing happens, leading to Flowey saying his infamous line "...But nobody came." Flowey proceeds to close in his ring of bullets to destroy the protagonist for good. However, when any one of the bullets hits the protagonist's SOUL, it fully refills the protagonist's HP, and any remaining bullets instantly vanish, similar to the first encounter with Flowey. Confused, Flowey attempts to load an alternate save file, but to his horror finds that he is suddenly unable to do so.

The human SOULs then exit again and fight back against Flowey, draining him of his power and destroying his new form, reducing him to his regular form as a battered flower. After this, the protagonist is given the option to either spare or kill him.

If the protagonist kills Flowey, he remarks "I knew you had it in you!" before dying and turning into "just a regular flower". However, if the protagonist spares him, Flowey insists that he has not changed at all, telling the protagonist that he would kill them and everyone they love if he is allowed to survive. The protagonist is then taken back to the FIGHT and MERCY buttons. Repeatedly pressing MERCY causes Flowey to become more and more confused and frustrated at the fact that he cannot understand why the protagonist is merciful to him, despite his moments-ago attempt to kill the protagonist and his threats towards the protagonist and their friends. After 13 total attempts to spare him, the protagonist finally sees success, as Flowey then flees.

In the event of a Neutral Route re-run, Flowey returns to kill Asgore, with his dialogue changing based on if he was killed or spared. If he was killed, he asks the protagonist if they thought killing him would make a difference and states that he will come back every time they load their SAVE. If he was spared, Flowey acknowledges that the human SOULs would revolt again if he tried to absorb the protagonist's. In either case, Flowey is not re-fought, and the game automatically cuts to the protagonist leaving the Underground.</mark></h1>
